# 🚖 Taxi Fare Prediction using Linear Regression

This repository contains a Google Colab-based Machine Learning exercise from the **Google Machine Learning Crash Course**. In this notebook, we train and evaluate a **Linear Regression model** to predict taxi fares in Chicago based on real-world data from the [City of Chicago Taxi Trips Dataset](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Taxi-Trips/wrvz-psew).
